#### Title: Analyzing the Changing Nature of the Mobile Phone Market
#### Author: Aryan Agarwal
#### Date: 9/11/2023


### Keywords: Mobile Phone Market Analysis, Correlation between prices and specifications, Data-driven price predictions
 
### Description: 
The objective of this project is to conduct an analysis of data obtained through web scraping from various online retailers. The primary focus of this analysis will be on the technical specs and pricing information of mobile phones. Through the analysis of this data, our objective is to gain insights into the patterns observed in mobile phone specifications, pricing trends, and maybe establish a correlation between specific specifications and their corresponding market prices. This knowledge has the potential to provide guidance to consumers in making well-informed decisions, as well as aiding firms in comprehending market trends.

### Intellectual Merit: 
This project provides an opportunity to comprehend the ever-changing trends in the market for cell phones. Through the examination of real-time data, valuable insights can be revealed regarding:

- The mobile phone specifications that are highly desired by consumers.
		
- The relationship between pricing trends and specific technical elements
		
- There may be areas within the market where specific standards are not adequately represented, leading to potential gaps. The presented research has the ability of providing consumers and manufacturers alike with practical insights, hence allowing improved decision-making in terms of purchasing and product development strategies.

### Data Sourcing: 
**Data Sources:**
The data will be scraped from leading smartphone selling websites such as Amazon, Best-Buy and others.

**Data to be Scrapped:**
- Data that would be scraped would include:
- The Mobile phone’s brand and Model
- Technical specifications such as RAM, Memory, Screen Size, Refresh Rate, Battery Capacity, Camera Specifications, etc.
- Sales data and prices

**Methodology:**
Web Scraping will be used to retrieve the necessary data from websites mentioned (both mentioned above) considering the ever-changing characteristic of the data we are using. Python libraries like Beautiful Soup might be used to extract this data

### Background Knowledge:
**Smartphone Market Analysis with A-Priori Algorithm: The Case Of Turkey [1]**
The purpose of this study was to analyze, using association rules, the technical characteristics of mobile phones with iOS and Android operating systems in order to determine which technical characteristics frequently occur together. The results obtained help with gaining a better comprehension of the characteristics of mobile phone market products.
