#### SER594: Project Proposal
#### Title: Analyzing the Changing Nature and Identifying Gaps in the Mobile Phone Market
#### Author: Aryan Agarwal
#### Date: 10/30/2023


#### Keywords: Mobile Phone Market Analysis, Correlation between prices and specifications, Data-driven gap predictions


#### Description: 
The objective of this project is to conduct an analysis of data obtained through web scraping from an online retailer. The primary focus of this analysis will be on the technical specs and pricing information of mobile phones. Through the analysis of this data, our objective is to gain insights into the patterns observed in mobile phone specifications, pricing trends, and maybe establish a correlation between specific specifications and their corresponding market prices. This knowledge has the potential to provide guidance to consumers in making well-informed decisions, as well as aiding firms in comprehending market trends.


#### Research Questions:
**RO1:** To describe the trends in the technical specifications and pricing of mobile phones offered in the online retail industry.

**RO2:** To find underrepresented technical specs in the mobile phone market's mid-price range using clustering algorithms.

**RO3:** To defend the model described in RO2 for identifying underrepresented technical specifications by assessing its accuracy and reliability in recognising market gaps.

**RO4:** To assess the effects of identified market gaps on consumer choice and manufacturer rivalry, and to generate actionable insights from these interactions.


#### Intellectual Merit: 
This project provides an opportunity to comprehend the ever-changing trends in the market for cell phones. Through the examination of real-time data, valuable insights can be revealed regarding:

1) The mobile phone specifications that are highly desired by consumers.
		
2) The relationship between pricing trends and specific technical elements
		
3) There may be areas within the market where specific standards are not adequately represented, leading to potential gaps. The presented research has the ability of providing consumers and manufacturers alike with practical insights, hence allowing improved decision-making in terms of purchasing and product development strategies.

4) Finding areas of the market with gaps where specific standards are underrepresented may create possibilities for producers and consumers alike. 


#### Data Sourcing: 
**Data Sources:** The data will be scraped from leading smartphone selling website (Amazon), for the scope of this project.

**Data to be Scrapped:**	Data that would be scraped would include:
							The Mobile phone’s brand and Model
							Technical specifications such as RAM, Memory, Screen Size, Battery Capacity and Item Weight.
							Sales data based on user ratings and prices

**Methodology:** Web Scraping will be used to retrieve the necessary data from the websit mentioned. Considering the ever-changing characteristic of the data we are using, scraping seems like the best data gathering technique for this project. Python libraries like Beautiful Soup might be used to extract this data.
