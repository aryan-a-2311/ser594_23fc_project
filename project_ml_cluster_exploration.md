## Justifications for Dataset

**Source:** There are a couple of values in the dataset that are unrealistic on the first glance but they have been checked out to be true.

**Justification for keeping them in the set:** It is imperative to uphold a diverse dataset in order to facilitate a thorough analysis and modelling procedure. Although atypical, these outliers may offer significant insights into possible discrepancies and anomalies present in the dataset. Furthermore, it is important to note that real-world data is not consistently constant and such irregularities may indicate legitimate discrepancies in product specifications or errors in data collection. Through the preservation of such data points, we guarantee the robustness of our analysis and its ability to accommodate unforeseen fluctuations. In addition, omitting these entries may result in the omission of crucial information; therefore, it is critical to prevent selective data removal from introducing bias into the findings. Hence, the preservation of these entries featuring non-standard values enhances the integrity of the dataset and guarantees a more comprehensive comprehension of the fundamental trends and patterns.
